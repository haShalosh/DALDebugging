About:
These are classes and functions I came up with to help me while debugging.

After you add them to your project, and configure the 1 non-ARC file to not use ARC,
The easiest way to use these is with the NSObject+Introspection category.

You can ask any class what ivars, properties or methods that it has.
If you ask the instance, it will recusively tell you all the ivars, properties or methods it has, and try to get the value of it.
